# Algorithmic Intelligence 
[HOME](https://autognorics.github.io/) 

As part of a paper originally published in 2k and revised several times due to new discoveries and fresh ideas uncovered in the Bowlingual Experiment Research dubbed ZERO, some of its findings, in particular the knowledge behind Aneural Consciousness, Intuitive Objects (IOs), and Embedded Inscriptions (EIs), are shared in this article.

We also explore, in this article, the other cookies in the autognorics system.  Since, humans believe that the brain, where information is processed, and the heart, where the blood that acts as fuel is pumped throughout the human body, are important criteria of life, these misconceptions are totally debunked here.  Cookies, like the brain and the heart, are not totally necessary in the creation of a living system. The jellyfish is a good example of a living machine without a brain (aneural), a heart (acardial), and blood but well thought out to be alive.

In the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NNFL4SBlt4&feature=emb_title), the machine's algorithmic intelligence is explored using exyzforms for iMapping or Aneural Networking, which is like the brain but without the brain.  IOs are incorporated to bring the machine into another state of being known as Algorithmic Logic.

In the previous posts, the other levels of States of Being like being alive, being aware, and being conscious were explained, revised, and redefined. On this page, the fourth characteristic of life known as Aneural Logic is examined based on the Zizo Effect or the Second Option Rule.

Intention, an inner aneural state of being is illustrated in this experiment. The machine is programmed to a goal-oriented behavior of directing itself to a charging station -- to sleep and self-energize. It is also subjected to choose between cookies and M&Ms inside a jar. The intentions are not by-products of the brain but by the theory of codexation. The machine did not depend on the mind but on associative consciousness.

The machine presented in the video is alive, aware, conscious, and intuitively logical. However, again, the biotronic is not yet living or with life.

On the next page, The Robot who materialized information is presented. The topic is about sequentially designing and building a machine that is not only alive, aware, conscious, and intuitive, but neural and living as well.

On another note, the Bowlingual Experiment is about an Alaskan Malamute who was spatially tested to the Codexation Dilemma. It was also developed to design a Bark to Word or B2W translator between dogs and humans. In this exploratory endeavor, my four-legged best friend name Zero was the specimen  Afterwards, another dog, a chihuahua named Peanut was introduced in the controlled environment with an objective to reinvestigate and reconcile the findings uncovered in the Caveman in the Box Trilogy.  No animals in this experiment were harmed.
